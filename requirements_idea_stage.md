# Napkin to Silicon - Requirements (Idea Submission Version)

## 1. Problem Statement
Developers and students frequently sketch system designs, flowcharts, and data structures on whiteboards or paper. Translating these visual ideas into structured, executable code is time-consuming and error-prone.

There is currently no seamless system that converts visual thinking directly into production-ready code.

---

## 2. Proposed Solution
Napkin to Silicon is an AI-powered visual compiler that transforms hand-drawn sketches and diagrams into executable code across multiple programming languages.

Users:
1. Draw their idea on a visual canvas
2. Select a programming language
3. Generate structured code using AI
4. Review, download, or understand the output

---

## 3. Core Functional Requirements

- Visual canvas for drawing diagrams and system designs
- Multi-language code generation (C, C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, Swift, Kotlin)
- AI-powered diagram-to-code transformation
- Code explanation for learning and clarity
- Secure user authentication
- Compilation history tracking

---

## 4. AI Integration
AI is central to the system. The model:
- Interprets visual diagram structures
- Identifies components and relationships
- Generates executable, language-specific code
- Explains logic and best practices

Without AI, the system cannot function.

---

## 5. Target Users
- Students learning programming visually
- Developers prototyping system ideas
- Technical architects designing workflows
- Teams collaborating on whiteboard sessions

---

## 6. Impact
- Accelerates idea-to-implementation workflow
- Improves programming education
- Reduces friction between design and development
- Encourages creative thinking in coding

---

## 7. Feasibility
The system is designed using scalable cloud architecture and modern AI APIs. A working MVP validates technical feasibility and performance.
